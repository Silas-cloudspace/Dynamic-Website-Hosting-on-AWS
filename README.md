# Dynamic Website Hosting on AWS

This project demonstrates the deployment and hosting of a dynamic website on AWS, utilizing various services and components to ensure high availability, scalability, security, and fault tolerance.

## Architecture Overview

The website is hosted on EC2 instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets spanning two Availability Zones. The infrastructure leverages the following AWS resources:

•	Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where AWS resources are launched.                                                                                                        
•	Internet Gateway: Enables communication between the VPC instances and the internet.                                                                                                                                 
•	Security Groups: Act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.
•	Availability Zones: Multiple Availability Zones are used to increase reliability and fault tolerance.
•	Public Subnets: Host infrastructure components like the NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer.
•	Private Subnets: Host the web servers (EC2 instances) for enhanced security.
•	NAT Gateway: Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet.
•	EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint: Enables secure connections to EC2 instances within both public and private subnets.
•	Application Load Balancer: Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.
•	Auto Scaling Group: Automatically manages the EC2 instances hosting the website, ensuring availability, scalability, fault tolerance, and elasticity.
•	AWS Certificate Manager: Secures application communications with SSL/TLS certificates.
•	Simple Notification Service (SNS): Sends notifications about activities within the Auto Scaling Group.
•	Route 53: Provides DNS services for registering and managing the website's domain name.
•	S3 Bucket: Stores the application code and assets.
•	Amazon RDS: Provides a scalable, high-availability database service for storing dynamic content and application data.

## Deployment

The deployment of this infrastructure is automated using scripts and configuration files stored in a GitHub repository. The repository includes the following:

•	Reference Diagram: A visual representation of the AWS infrastructure and its components.                                                                                                                           
•	Deployment Scripts: Scripts to provision and configure the necessary AWS resources.
•	Configuration Files: Templates and configuration files for setting up the infrastructure.

## Usage

•	Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
•	Follow the instructions in the repository's documentation to set up the required AWS resources.
•	Deploy the website code and assets to the appropriate S3 bucket.
•	Access the website using the registered domain name.
